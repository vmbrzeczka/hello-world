# hello-world
simple git tasks
Hi! My name is Virginia Moré, I'm a semi-senior web developer with experience in building personalized and on-demand software. I have been working in Web Development for +8 years.

I have worked developing both alone and as a part of a team, and so I am predisposed to adapt to new environments, facing group challenges and also solitary tasks. Happy to work closely with any existing freelancers you work with.

Self-discipline, determination, and responsibility as a daily basis, I pursuit always the highest quality work and I focus on complete a project only with a 100% client satisfaction.

Awarded with Intel's ASDC “Scholarship to academic excellence 2009”, for being top of the class student.

Excellent communication skills, regular reports are important to me to ensure detail and correct completeness on project guidelines.

I'm fluent also in Spanish and Italian.
